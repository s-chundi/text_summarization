# text_summarization
Summarize long text that you don't feel like reading

Too often we are required to read long passages of text that we are not interested in. I absolutely advocate reading entire texts for subjects that one wishes to master, but things like TOS agreements, legal documents, homework assignments etc. are <em>sometimes</em> not worth reading. At times like these, we often wish we had some text summarization.

### Instructions:
<ol>
<li>Clone this repo (Or just open the ipynb in colab)</li>
<li>Copy your text into the "text" variable</li>
<li>Run all cells</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ol>

The more text you put in, the longer the code will take. In the meantime, watch some youtube, play on your phone, or read something you actually want to read :)
